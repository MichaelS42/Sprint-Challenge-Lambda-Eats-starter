# Single Page Applications Sprint Challenge

The sprint challenge is your chance to independently work through material and build on what you learned this week. In today's project you will build a form for Lambda Eats, a website designed to bring food to hungry coders.

## Introduction

In this challenge you will be working from the `Lambda Eats` homepage to create a functional `Pizza?` button that leads to a build your own pizza custom form.

## **Self-Study Questions**

Demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering the following free-form questions.

Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read by your Team Lead.




1. In 1-2 sentences, explain what React's `useRouteMatch` hook is used for.
	- React's useRouteMatch hook is used to add nested Routes to an application. It can read paths and urls and be utilized 
	  to deconstruct them in order to route them dynamically.  


2. How would you explain form validation to someone who has never programmed before?
	-  Validation can be explained to someone who has never programmed before as the text prompt that populates if the information
entered into a field in a form is not a valid input. Examples of this are when not enough characters are entered into field that has a minimum requirement
and if a user clicks submit before checking a  required box. Essentially, it is when there are specific values that a user needs to input in order for
the form to accept it. If the inputs entered by a user meets the requirements in certain fields like a text box or email field the data is valid. If the values
don't meet the expectations of the form's schema then users won't be able to either continue and/or submit the form.


3. In 1-2 sentences, define end to end testing.
	- End to end testing focuses on the UI part of an app by simulating the way a user would naviagate through a website like a sign up page. Signing up
for a website is an action. The end to end testing would progress through the various tasks of signing up and illuminate issues with the design and functional set up.


You are expected to be able to answer all these questions. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. Skipping this section **will** prevent you from passing this challenge.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Set Up The Project With Git

Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:

- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project.
- [ ] Add your project manager as collaborator on Github.
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Lambda's by mistake!).
- [ ] CD into the project base directory.
- [ ] Download project dependencies by running `npm install`
- [ ] Start up the app usingÂ `npm start`
- [ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -bÂ `<firstName-lastName>`. Implement the project on your newly createdÂ `<firstName-lastName>`Â branch, committing changes regularly.
- [ ] Push commits: git push originÂ `<firstName-lastName>`.

### Task 2: Minimum Viable Product

Your MVP should include, at a minimum, the following components.

- [ ] A homepage that has a "/" route and links to your form (button, nav bar, or any other type of link is acceptable)
- [ ] A form with a "/pizza" route
- [ ] A name text input field
- [ ] Validation for name - name must be at least 2 characters
- [ ] Dropdown form component for pizza size
- [ ] Checklist form component for toppings - at least 4 (hint: name each separately!)
- [ ] Text input form component for special instructions
- [ ] An Add to Order button that submits form and returns a database record of name, pizza size, sauce, and special instructions

#### Testing MVP

Implement the following tests in Cypress:

- [ ] test that you can add text to the box
- [ ] test that you can select multiple toppings
- [ ] test that you can submit the form

You may use the following wireframe (also in a folder above) as guidance as you design your site but it is not required that you do so.

## Task 3: Stretch Goals

If you complete the MVP, move on to the following stretch goals. As usual, these goals represent a mix of additional at-level work in addition to work that is beyond the scope of what you've learned, but attainable with your current knowledge (and google).

- [ ] Toggle form component for gluten free crust
- [ ] Turn your form into a modal that pops up on the home page
- [ ] Turn form element sections into nested routes
- [ ] Create a `cart` page with additional form options like: delivery or pickup, the option to add utensils and straws, add a tip, etc.
- [ ] Test more of the application with Cypress
- [ ] Add functionality to your order button that it leads to a Congrats! Pizza is on it's way! page **and** returns a database record of the whole order

## FAQs

**How do I return a database record of the order?**

One of your goals is to return a database record of the order - for this you'll need to write a post request. For more detailed steps, use the below:

1. Create a new state
2. Post to [reqres](https://reqres.in/) database with `axios`
3. Log data in console

## Submission format

Follow these steps for completing your project.

- [ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student's Repo). **Please don't merge your own pull request**
- [ ] Add your project manager as a reviewer on the pull-request
- [ ] Your TL will count the project as complete by merging the branch back into master.
